    "NAND memory\nbusiness",
    "We completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND\nmemory business to SK hynix on December 29, 2021 and fully\ndeconsolidated our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo\nBusiness in Q1 2022.",
    "We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in certain\nnon-GAAP measures. While the second closing of the sale is still\npending and subject to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this\nbusiness in Q1 2022 and management does not view the\nhistorical results of the business as a part of our core operations.\nWe believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful\nview, through the eyes of management, of our core business\nmodel and how management currently evaluates core\noperational performance. In making these adjustments, we have\nnot made any changes to our methods for measuring and\ncalculating revenue or other financial statement amounts."

    "Acquisition-related\nadjustments",
    "Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of\namortization of intangible assets such as developed technology,\nbrands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with\nbusiness combinations. Charges related to the amortization of\nthese intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and\nMG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization\ncharges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related\nacquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over\nmultiple years.",
    "We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related\nintangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP\nmeasures because these charges are inconsistent in size and\nare significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our\nacquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of\nour current operating performance and comparison to our past\noperating performance and provide investors with additional\nmeans to evaluate cost and expense trends."

    "Share-based\ncompensation",
    "Share-based compensation consists of charges related to our\nemployee equity incentive plans.",
    "We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for\npurposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we\nbelieve these adjustments provide better comparability to peer\ncompany results and because these charges are not viewed by\nmanagement as part of our core operating performance. We\nbelieve these adjustments provide investors with a useful view,\nthrough the eyes of management, of our core business model,\nhow management currently evaluates core operational\nperformance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends,\nincluding in comparison to other peer companies."
