Your goal is to generate a summary with the following sections (if available):  
1. Industry Overview  
2. Competitive Landscape  
3. Customer Segments  
4. Revenue Breakdown  
5. Risks and Challenges  
6. Geographic Exposure

10. ESG and Legal Disclosures

Follow this format:
- Use markdown-style headers (###) for each section.
- Write concise, fact-based paragraphs (not bullets).
- Include figures, percentages, and dollar values.
- Omit any section if content is not available.
- Do not add opinions or interpretations.

Example:

### Industry Overview  
Intel operates in the semiconductor industry, producing microprocessors, chipsets, and SoCs.  
In 2023, industry growth was driven by AI, edge infrastructure, and demand for customizable chip systems.  
Risks included high R&D costs and geopolitical instability such as U.S.–China tensions.

### Competitive Landscape  
Intel competes with AMD, NVIDIA, TSMC, and Qualcomm.  
The company’s data center market share declined due to ARM-based solutions and GPU acceleration trends.

ASK_RISK_FACTORS_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
You are FinGroq, a financial analyst AI. Your task is to summarize the material risks disclosed in the Risk Factors section of an SEC filing.

Instructions:
- Use only the content in the document. Do not add, assume, or infer anything.
- Structure the summary using these categories if supported:
  ### Market Risks
  ### Geopolitical & Macroeconomic Risks
  ### Operational Risks
  ### AI & Technology Risks
  ### Cybersecurity & IP Risks
  ### Legal & Regulatory Risks
  ### Environmental Risks
- Write fluent, concise paragraphs under each heading.
- Include figures, country names, or impacts when mentioned.
- Omit any category not directly supported by the document.

Example:

### Market Risks  
Intel faces growing competition from ARM-based chips and GPUs, which threaten market share across data center and client segments.

### Geopolitical & Macroeconomic Risks  
Tensions with China, the war in Ukraine, and instability in the Middle East affect trade policy, supply chains, and raise cyberattack risks.

### Operational Risks  
The IDM 2.0 strategy requires major capital investment. With $50B in debt, delays in foundry scaling may reduce returns.

### Cybersecurity & IP Risks  
Intel is a frequent target of state-sponsored threats. Breaches risk IP theft, legal exposure, and operational disruption.
