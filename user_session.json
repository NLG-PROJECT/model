This decline may be attributed to various factors, including changes in market demand, competition, and macroeconomic conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the net revenue in 2023 is $54,228 million, which is a decrease from the previous two years. This information can be useful for investors, analysts, and other stakeholders to understand the company's financial performance and make informed decisions."
